# Capstone_Project_2

The Footy Football App is built by `React` for the front-end and `Express` for the back-end, with a `PostgreSQL` database. It is a `full-stack` application where both front-end and back-end parts are almost equally detailed.

Although the responsive web page principles are implemented during the building of the application, mainly the web users are targeted. But the app also has neat usability on handheld devices.

The goal of this web application is to reach needed football information seamlessly. Football enthusiasts of any age and anywhere are the main target of this application.

The required data is gathered from [Api-Football](https://www.api-football.com/)'s API. Some of the information they offer in their free plan is included, where teams, players, league standings & fixtures, lineups, and top scorers are some of them.

`Bcrypt` is used for sensitive data stored in the database. The database has a table for users' information like username, password, email, and favorite stuff. Any other tables will be added as needed.

As extra functionality, a fantasy football feature is being considered.
