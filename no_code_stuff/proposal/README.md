# Capstone Project 2 Proposal

I will use `React` for the front-end and `Express` for the back-end in this project, the database will be written by `PostgreSQL`. It will be a `full-stack` application where both front-end and back-end parts are almost equally detailed.

Although the responsive web page principles will be implemented during the building of the application, mainly the web users are targeted. But the app will have also neat usability on handheld devices.

The goal of this web application will be to reach needed football information seamlessly. Football enthusiasts of any age and anywhere are the main target of this application.

The data needed will be gathered from [Api-Football](https://www.api-football.com/)'s API. Some combination of the information they are offering in their free plan will be covered, where teams, players, league standings & fixtures, lineups, and top scorers are some of them.

The database will have a table for users' information like username, password, email, and favorite stuff. Any other tables will be added as needed. `Bcrypt` will be used for sensitive data stored in the database.

As extra functionality, a fantasy football feature is being considered.
